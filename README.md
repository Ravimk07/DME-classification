# DME-classification
Presents an efficient DME vs. normal classification approach based
on fine tuning recent CNNs

A pre-trained CNN is fine-tuned
for a classification of DME versus normal cases. The fine-tuned Inception-Resnet-v2
CNN model can effectively identify pathologies in comparison to classical learning.
